<p>Detects invalid usage of precedence annotations on alternatives
</p>
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
    Here's a list of the problems this inspections tries to detect:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        if there's at least one alternative with precedence annotations in a rule, then all the alternatives must be
        annotated
    </li>
    <li>
        syntax (precedence annotations have a level argument that is an integer, associativity annotations have a side
        argument)
    </li>
    <li>
        the first level cannot have associativity annotations.
    </li>
</ul>
